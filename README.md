# solve_poisson_equation
The idea is to consider a discretization of the domain into a grid (or mesh) with a finite number of nodes where the solution of the partial derivative equation will be approximated by a five-point finite difference scheme with homogeneous spacing.
This approximation results in a linear system that we will solve by computer.
