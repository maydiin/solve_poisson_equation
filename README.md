# Solving the Poisson Equation
The idea is to consider a discretization of the domain into a grid (or mesh) with a finite number of nodes where the solution of the partial derivative equation will be approximated by a five-point finite difference scheme with homogeneous spacing.
This approximation results in a linear system that we will solve by computer.

Borders functions and source function should make change according to the system. At most, you must change the parameter of solution function, if you want more detail.
